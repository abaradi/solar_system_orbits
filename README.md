# Solar System Model

A python script that simulates, in 2 dimensional Cartesian coordinates, the orbits and the motion of 10 bodies in the solar system(the Sun, the 8 planets, and the dwarf planet Pluto). The orbits are generated by solving Newton's equations of gravity for each body. For a detailed discription of the underlying physics and the algorithms used in the model take a look at the [Solar System](/model/Solar%20System.pdf) pdf file.
