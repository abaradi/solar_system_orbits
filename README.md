# Solar System Model

<code> Wait for the page to fully load to see a gif of the animation. If it's not loading refresh the page. The file sizes has been optimized as much as possible but they're still pretty large compared to python scripts. I recommend downloading the mp4 animations [Orbitial Motion of the First Five Planets](/Five%20Planets.mp4) and [Orbital Motion of the Outer Planets](/Outer%20Planets.mp4)</code>

A python script that simulates, in 2 dimensional Cartesian coordinates, the orbits and the motion of 10 bodies in the solar system(the Sun, the 8 planets, and the dwarf planet Pluto). The orbits are generated by solving Newton's equations of gravity for each body. For a detailed discription of the underlying physics and the algorithms used in the model take a look at the [Solar System](/model/Solar%20System.pdf) pdf file.

## Motion of the first five planets

## Planetary Orbits
